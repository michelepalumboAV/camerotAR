# camerotAR
The context in which I decided to focus my project is linked to the historical and cultural heritage that gradually reveals itself increasingly abandoned and not valued. And this is a problem. In particular, we refer to the &lt;Rock Chapel "S.Vito" of Camerota, in the province of Salerno> which needs help to be known and appreciated. The goal of safeguarding this chapel is certainly that of intervening in some way. My idea was to develop an augmented reality application to attract more and more visitors and curious. The application, through the use of the smartphone camera, is able to display information of any type (text, audio, video, 2d and 3d models) using "target images" positioned outside and inside the chapel.

The tools and languages, which I used for the development of the application, are:
- for 2D MODELS: Photoshop and Canva
- for 3D MODELS: SketchUp
- for the APPLICATION: Unity3D, Vuforia and C#
